# Disabled programmer setup
It's my storage for all editor settings which allow me to code quickier with my two working fingers.
It's my private setup but if you have similar problem and you will inspire from this - you are welcome :-)

## Common keymap
Keymap at least should contain those keys.

*It was easier to write them down in notepad, instead of creating keymap in editor first. This keymap might break many conventions
but keep in mind that it's optimized for programmer with paralyzed hands. For me, three keys combination is waste of time and effort*



|Key combination| Command                                                       |
