# Disabled programmer setup
It's my storage for all editor settings which allow me to code quickier with my only two working fingers.
It's my private setup but if you have similar problem and you will inspire from this - you are welcome :-)

## Common keymap
Standard programmer editors' keymaps mostly use three letter combinations!
For what you need standard Ctrl+D "Print"? When lastly you printed something straight from your editor? I bet you even don't have a printer.
Pressing three keys at once isn't rocket science. But you will probably agree, that in deep it feels "harder" and "less natural" than using two letter keys combination. (It's also true for two keys & one key, but our keyboards aren't that big)

It's important to have this keys setup everywhere && frequently remove unused mappings. This way it's much more easier to remember, and you will not feel it is becoming deprecated.

*It was easier to write them down in notepad, instead of creating keymap in editor first, because standard keymap will not mix with your own. Such reference is easy to memoize. This keymap might break many conventions but keep in mind that it's optimized for programmer with paralyzed hands. For me, three keys combination is waste of time and effort. For you, probably also*
